#### Student Name: ****Shishir Patel****

#### Subject: ****Let's learn LUA****

#### Main Sources:
[neovim](https://neovim.io)
[LUA](https://lua.org)
[https://luarocks.org/#quick-start](LuaRocks) 

#### Build
Using LUA to build out a basic IDE and populate with plugins from the NVim community to show a working version of a text editor that can be used to develop apps and websites that can act as a replacement to VSCode.
